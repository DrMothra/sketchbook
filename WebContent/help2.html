<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A Sketchbook comprises a set of Sketces</p><p>A Sketch has a title and description (the title is the first line of the description), and a drawing.</p>
<p>A sketch can have another sketch as its background. This allows it
to act as an overlay on the background sketch, for example to annotate
the background sketch to raise questions about what is shown or
identify key issues. The background sketch can be "faded" to make the
overlay more visible.<br>
</p>

<p>A Sketch drawing can include (references to) other Sketches. For
example one Sketch might represent a user, another a device, a third
Sketch might then show the user and the device in a certain context.</p>
<p>An Sketch drawing can include named Frames. These are rectangular
regions which are highlighted as areas of particular interest,
analogous to the frames in a cartoon. Frames can also mark areas of
varaible content, for example where the content of other sketches or
frames might be shown in a sequence.<br>
</p>
<p>Frames can be organised into Sequences (not yet implemented), which
can represent possible sequences of events or narrative flow.</p>
<p>There can in principle be many Sequences.</p><p>In principle (not yet implemented) Sketches could be developed
collaboratively, and track changes made and who has made those changes,
for example in a collaborative design process.</p>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Note that the user interface is non-standard, representing in part
some explorations of interaction proposals in Harold Thimbleby's book
on User Interface Design</p>
<p>The Index tab shows all current Sketches. Sketches also appear as tabs if/when they are edited.</p>
<p>The Sequences tab is intended to show and edit sequences of Frames; at present it lists Sketches and their frames only.</p><p>The
Selection history shows recently selected things (drawing elements,
Sketches, images). Selecting within the Selection history will make
that item the current selection, e.g. ready to copy.</p><p>An image can be inserted by Loading it into the Selection history and then Copying it in a Sketch</p><p>Sketches can be saved as a JSON-encoded data file using the Save and Choose file buttons at the top.</p>
