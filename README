sketchbook - tinkering with a paper.js-based diagramming/sketching/authoring tool for ubicomp experiences.

A few implementation notes (for version 2, sketcher2.html), for the bold...

Uses Paper.js http://paperjs.org/ as an API over HTML5 canvas, JQuery http://jquery.com/ for general DOM manipulation and a couple of third-party utilities to plug holes in HTML5 support for local files

More or less MVC with Sketchbook (and in turn Sketch and Sequence) in sketchbook.js as the model, sketcher2.js as the view/control harness, sketchertools.js pulls together the various drawing/manipulation tools. 

Strictly Sketchbook corresponds to the JSON file; there is some other internal state that is not persisted, in particular the selection and selection history which is really important for tying stuff together. 

The application also uses the actual state of the page elements (e.g. CSS styles added to/removed from button and other elements) to maintain some of its working state.

Sketcher2.html has the static HTML and sketcher2.css the CSS for layout.

Model update uses a Command pattern (the Action class in sketchbook.js), so that undo support should be straight-forward when i get time.
